This repository is part of the Holmes benchmark and assesses linguistic knowledge within language models in three steps.
1. **Encoding** In this step, we encode inputs of the probing datasets using the provided language model and dumps these encodings locally.
2. **Probing** Secondly, we train the probes using the encoded probing datasets and dump results and predictions (optional) locally.
3. **Evaluating** Finally, we gather all results of the probes to get an overview of the linguistic abilities of the give language model.
